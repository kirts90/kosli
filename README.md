There are many ways to serve websites on AWS. Your goal is to do research and pick two ways. You should be able to explain the reasons for your choice and why you decided against others.
-You should provision all necessary infra using Terraform.
-You should not store Terraform state locally. Pick any supported backend.
-Changes to HTML should cause redeployment.
-DNS name or IP address should stay the same after redeployment
-TLS is optional
-You should be able to deploy the same code into two different AWS accounts (think dev and prod). There should be a possibility to specify different parameters between accounts. For instance, the name of the ssh key if you are to go with EC2.
-Please store Terraform code on GitHub and share a link to the repo with us.
-CI setup is optional.
